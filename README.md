<h2>Project Description</h2>
Books Tracker is a web application designed for managing a personal book library and tracking reading progress. 
Administrators have full control over the book database, including adding new books, editing existing ones, 
deleting books, and managing user accounts. Users can browse available books and add them to their personal 
lists, assigning statuses such as read, in progress, and to read. This project is perfect for book enthusiasts 
looking to organize their library and keep track of their reading progress.
